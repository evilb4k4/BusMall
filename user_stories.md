Dev: Bus mall would like an app that gathers data on what product their customer would like to see in there catalog.

2. As the user when I select an image on the app it should automaticlly refresh with 3 new images to select onece again(i should be able to do this 25 times).

3. As the user When I reach has 25 votes the app should display a result list of the most selected images.
